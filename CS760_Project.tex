\section{Introduction}
With the global outbreak of COVID-19, it's even more important to have some policy to mitigate risk. For public safety and health, people are recommended to wear masks to control the spread of the COVID-19.

In hospitals and COVID-19 testing places, only people wearing masks are allowed to enter, which can reduce the risk of accidental infection of staff.

Similarly, requiring Uber drivers and passengers to wear masks can also effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19. The only way to detect whether drivers and passengers are wearing masks and not infringing on user privacy is to use AI for local monitoring.

With the global outbreak of COVID-19, personal protection has become particularly important. Facial recognition technology is indispensable for community access management, face access control, and station face gates.

the COVID-19 mask detector could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others.

With the ongoing pandemic, itâ€™s even more important to have advanced analytics apps and services in place to mitigate risk. For public safety and health, authorities are recommending the use of face masks and coverings to control the spread of COVID-19.
