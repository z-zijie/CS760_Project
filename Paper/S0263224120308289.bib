abstract = "The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health crisis. One of the effective protection methods is wearing a face mask in public areas according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In this paper, a hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for face mask detection will be presented. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for feature extraction using Resnet50. While the second component is designed for the classification process of face masks using decision trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble algorithm. Three face masked datasets have been selected for investigation. The Three datasets are the Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD), the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). The SVM classifier achieved 99.64% testing accuracy in RMFD. In SMFD, it achieved 99.49%, while in LFW, it achieved 100% testing accuracy."

abstract = "Deep learning has shown tremendous potential in many real-life applications in different domains. One of these potentials is object detection. Recent object detection which is based on deep learning models has achieved promising results concerning the finding of an object in images. The objective of this paper is to annotate and localize the medical face mask objects in real-life images. Wearing a medical face mask in public areas, protect people from COVID-19 transmission among them. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for the feature extraction process based on the ResNet-50 deep transfer learning model. While the second component is designed for the detection of medical face masks based on YOLO v2. Two medical face masks datasets have been combined in one dataset to be investigated through this research. To improve the object detection process, mean IoU has been used to estimate the best number of anchor boxes. The achieved results concluded that the adam optimizer achieved the highest average precision percentage of 81% as a detector. Finally, a comparative result with related work has been presented at the end of the research. The proposed detector achieved higher accuracy and precision than the related work."

  abstract={In this paper, a deep learning based method, aided by certain clustering algorithm for use in semantic segmentation of satellite images in complex background is proposed. The work considers the formation and training of SegNet in which the output of K-means clustering algorithm is used as input and the label of the particular region of interest (ROI) in the image are used as target. The method does not require any feature extraction, region growing or splitting methods to configure and train the SegNet, which is a deep convolutional Encoder-Decoder architecture trained with (error) Back Propagation learning. The method is tested with different satellite images. The method is also compared with the results obtained when trained with SegNet without selecting the ROI using K-means algorithm and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, mean IoU and weighted IoU. The normalized confusion matrix is also plotted. The experimental results show that the method is reliable and suitable for real world situations.},
